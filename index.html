        <p>The Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[14][15][17] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[15][4]

            Houghton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public.

              <p>Harvard University is one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the nation and the world. The rigor and the quality of education is what gave Harvard global recognition. Although the college admissions process may be intricate, the idea of attending Harvard some day would be an astonishing achievement. Harvard University, unlike any other institution in the United States, is confined to a few scholars. The school is small, yet the name instantly gives you a stimulant to boost your self-esteem. I always favored quality over quantity. Harvard University was founded in 1636 by the General Court of Massachusetts Bay, and was named after its first donor, Reverend John Harvard. Attending this university would feed my obsession with history. I come to from a humble background, yet stepping into the shoes of these historic visionaries will be the highlight of my potential career and, possibly, my life.</p>

              <p>Harvard is incredible! The campus is vibrant and there are always tourists. It is especially busy during fall because the foliage is beautiful. The professors are very knowledgeable. Most write their own textbooks, so they truly know what they are teaching. The students are also great; they are intellectual, fun, and laidback. It is a great experience studying here!</p>
